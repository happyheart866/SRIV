# SRIV

To facilitate the recognition of people's social relations from videos, we build a benchmark dataset, named  Social Relation In Videos (SRIV). It consists of 3,124 videos, 24 hours and 678 pairwise people interactions, which collects video clips from movies and TV dramas.

The paper that presents this dataset is being reviewed in a double-blind manner. Due to copyright issues, we will release this dataset at the same time as the paper gets published.
