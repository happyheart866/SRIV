# SRIV

To facilitate the recognition of people's social relations from videos, we build a benchmark dataset, named  Social Relation In Videos (SRIV). It consists of 3,124 videos, 24 hours, 12 classes, which collects video clips from movies and TV dramas.

Because the videos in the database may be subject to copyright, we do not make them publicly available. If you are a researcher who wish to have a copy of the videos for educational or non-commercial use, we may provide you access. Please contact to us lvjinna@bupt.edu.cn, wubin@bupt.edu.cn.
